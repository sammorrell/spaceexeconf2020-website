I am a 1st year PhD student working in the Galactic Archaeology group at the Landessternwarte (State Observatory) in Heidelberg, Germany. My work involves constraining the abundance of Silicon in the Sun using 3D stellar models, as well as investigating the various processes that occur within stellar atmospheres. In my talk, I will outline the science of space weather, its causes and effects, and how we might overcome the issues ‘storms’ could cause.

Space weather is a branch of physics, concerned with the time varying conditions within the Solar System, including the solar wind, emphasizing the space surrounding the Earth. This wind is caused by magnetic fields and convection within the Sun, and it itself is magnetised. Our planet’s magnetic field protects us from this barrage of material, keeping our atmosphere intact. However, sufficiently powerful magnetism in the wind could disable satellites as well as our systems here on the Earth, and so it is important to understand and be able to predict such phenomena.
