I may be familiar to some, as I am the former president of Space:Exe, and I have just finished PhD in the Astrophysics group at the University of Exeter. My research involves using cutting-edge datasets and novel fitting methodologies to measure the sizes and temperatures of stars. 

In my talk, I will introduce you to the fundamental parameters which dictate the characteristics and evolution of all stars, and describe how we have been able to harness novel data analysis techniques and the large quantities of new and existing archival observations to measure them. I will also show you how assembling stellar samples of unprecedented size, precision and accuracy have allowed us to solve some of the long standing problems in low-mass stellar evolution and exoplanet science.
