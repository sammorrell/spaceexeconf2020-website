Tim Naylor is the Norman Lockyer Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Exeter.  His research has covered a broad range of stellar astrophysics from black holes to young stars and now includes planet planet-hunting.


We have long known that planets must form in the discs around young stars, but it is becoming increasingly clear these are rather hostile places for planet formation.  This talk will cover the basics of planet formation, and discuss new evidence as to how difficult it may be.
