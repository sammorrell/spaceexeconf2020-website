# About the Conference

One thing we are passionate about as a society is sharing the wonders of the universe with everyone. 
This is one of the reasons we are delighted to be organising a second all-day conference devoted to all things space.
Once again, we have some fantastic speakers coming from the University of Exeter, Met Office, University of Plymouth, Norman Lockyer Observatory, and our collaborators Caradon Observatory. 
This year we also have an open area where we have exhibitors from the Institute of Physics, Royal Astronomical Society, Norman Lockyer Observatory and others are coming along to show you some of the wonderful astronomy and space science related things going on in the South West. 

To keep up to date, please do visit our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/145065299932425/).
Everyone is welcome to come along for a single talk or for the whole day. 
We look forward to seeing you.
